Hello :)

Since that [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) have announced the selected organizations and I decided to try apply for [Portus](http://port.us.org), some issues had to be closed by me! Because one of the criteria to select a student was exactly this: close some small issues from the project.

Before submit my project proposal to GSoC I made three Pull Requests to solve these issues: ["Logout and repository search in small devices"](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/772), ["Activity messages do not fill all the horizontal space available"](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/487) and ["The error message is not always located in the user's field of vision"](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/issues/586).

Unfortunately, I took too long to make the necessary updates on my last [pull request](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/pull/781). But in June 1 my PR was finally merged! And I could start my first GSoC issue: Improve the responsiviness of Portus.

That issue will be present during all the coding period of GSoC. Actually, this issue isn't only one issue, it's a list of enhancements in Portus related to improve the user experience on all devices. For now, we have four items on our list:


<div class="post-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Propose a model to improve the tables on small screens,</li>
    <li>Refactor admin dashboard to each option occupy one row,</li>
    <li>Change Portus logo png for a svg logo and</li>
    <li>Refactor portus website/blog topbar.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

Three days ago I submitted a [Pull Request](https://github.com/SUSE/Portus/pull/916) proposing a new topbar design and layout to solve the last one issue and today I finished the improvements suggested by the reviewer [@cyntss](https://github.com/cyntss). I hope it is correct!

You can click on the links in this text and see some screenshots of the before and after my contributions :)

Good bye and see you on the next post!

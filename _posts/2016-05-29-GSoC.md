Hi!

My life with web development started with backend systems development in python, but some time ago I've had enough interest on frontend development. Since I knew [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) I'm looking for projects that involves frontend issues and enhancements and the [openSUSE 101](http://101.opensuse.org/) page cought my attention for being different from the "wiki" stardard from the other organizations. When I saw ["Improve the UI of Portus"](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/44) I thought: "That's it!", and started to contribute with the project, working on small UI issues. After two merge requests accepted I started writing my GSoC proposal.

On April 22 I received a great, really great, news: my project proposal was accepted and I was working with [Miquel Sabatè Solá](http://github.com/mssola), my project mentor, during the next three months, to reach the following goals:


<div class="post-list">
  <ul>
    <li>Improve the responsivity of Portus, specially on small screens;</li>
    <li>Serve assets only when used;</li>
    <li>Improve search and filter features;</li>
    <li>Improve dashboard interface;</li>
    <li>Create a help section on Portus page;</li>
    <li>Create a "Explore" feature, and</li>
    <li>Don't allow users access to the hidden team.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

For these goals, CSS, JavaSript/CoffeScript and HTML skills are essential! Also, a previous knowledge about Ruby on Rails would be great because some issues need updates on application code too. Unfortunately, Rails is a framework that I don't have much experiences but my background with the Django framework could help to understand quickly how the Rails works.

I'm sure that this summer will be great!

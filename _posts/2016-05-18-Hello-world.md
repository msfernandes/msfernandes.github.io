Hello, world!

Welcome to my blog! I hope that I can help you in some way with my experiences,
histories, tips and codes. Enjoy, but first let me introduce myself...

My name is Matheus Fernandes, I'm a Software Engineering student at Universidade
de Bras√≠lia, Brazil. I love code and Python is my preferred language! In the free time I like to play electric or acoustic guitar, but lately I don't have much time for this :(

I started to work with software development in 2011 when I entered in my graduation course. It was love at first code! Since my fourth period at University I have been working as developer in private and government companies, also in research programs in the university.

The real reason for me to start this blog will be explained in the next post, but I'll continue posting regardless of anything, because I really think that I can help people doing this.

See you on the next post!
